	 Double Sided Quad Truchet
	--------------------------

	BigWIngs posted a really interesting weave pattern the other day that I wanted to
    recreate for my own amusement. I like it because the premise is incredibly simple, 
	but	it leads to visually entertaining results -- In fact, I'm amazed at just how
    much variation it provides. The link to his orginal example is below.

	The idea is very simple: Instead of rendering two sets of arcs connecting the
    midpoints of the grid cell boundaries (like with a standard Truchet arc pattern), 
	double the connecting points on each edge, then connect four arc-like segments
    between them -- Bezier curves are a good option, but not mandatory. The four 
	curve segments each connect random pairs of entry and exit points, which result 
	in the crazy spaghetti pattern you see. :)

	BigWIngs rendered some presets and left the overall random pattern rendering as 
	an exercise to the reader, so I gave it a go. I had to think about it for a while, 
	but then realized all that was required was to shuffle an array of 8 points, 
	then render the shuffled pairs. It seems to work, but I'm open to suggestion, if 
	there's a better way.

    I also went out of my way to append smooth Bezier curves, which look fine, but my 
	methodology was a bit hacky, so I'm hoping BigWIngs, or someone else, will come up 
	with something more robust.

	I didn't spend a great deal of time prettying this up, so I'm not sure what style
	this is rendered in. Art deco grunge? :) I might bump map it later to make it pop
	out a bit more, or make a 3D version. By the way, if you wanted to produce a 3D 
	extruded version, you'd probably have to replace the Bezier curves with a mixture 
	of arcs and lines, which would be much faster.
